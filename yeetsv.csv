Fund Summary Growth Fund




The Fund typically makes equity investments in the following three types of companies:
Growth Industry Leaders: Companies in this category often have leadership positions in growing markets. In some cases these companies may have dominant market share. These companies tend to be larger and more established.
Consistent Growers: Companies in this category generally exhibit steady earnings or revenue growth, or both. These companies may have subscription or other recurring revenue profiles. Given their business models, these companies may outperform in weak markets.
Emerging Growth Companies: Companies often addressing a new market or carving out a niche in an existing market. Companies in this category may experience rapid growth, and tend to be smaller, earlier stage companies. These companies may exhibit high volatility.
Inclusion of any investment in any of the three described categories represents the opinion of the advisor concerning the characteristics and prospects of the investment. There is no assurance that any company selected for investment will, once categorized in one of the three described investment categories, continue to have the positive characteristics or fulfill the expectations that the advisor had for the company when it was selected for investment, and any such company may not grow or may decline in earnings and size.
In conjunction with individual issuer analysis, Thornburg may identify and invest at times with a greater emphasis in industries or economic sectors it expects to experience growth.  This approach may at times produce a greater emphasis on investment in certain industries or economic sectors, such as technology, financial services, healthcare or biotechnology.  The Fund does not have a strategy to invest in particular industry or economic sectors, and its exposures to particular industries or economic sectors are expected to vary over time. Investment decisions are also based on domestic and international economic developments, outlooks for securities markets, interest rates and inflation, and the supply and demand for debt and equity securities.
Debt obligations, usually with associated equity features, occasionally will be considered for investment when Thornburg believes them to be more attractive than equity alternatives. The Fund may purchase debt obligations of any maturity and of any credit quality, including “high yield” or “junk” bonds. There is no minimum credit quality or rating of debt obligation the Fund may purchase.

 The Fund typically makes equity investments in the following three types of companies: 
Growth Industry Leaders are fast growing companies that appear to have proprietary advantages in industry segments that are experiencing rapid growth. Stocks
of these companies generally sell at premium valuations (relative to the S&P Composite 1500 Index).  Consistent Growth companies. Stocks in
this category generally sell at premium valuations (relative to the S&P Composite 1500 Index) and tend to show steady earnings or cash flow growth, or both. There are no assurances that these trends will continue in the future. 
Emerging Growth companies are typically growing companies that in Thornburgs opinion are in the process of establishing a leading position in a
significant product, service or market and which Thornburg expects will grow, or continue to grow, at a rate exceeding the growth of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). These companies may not be profitable at the time of purchase.
 In conjunction with individual issuer analysis, Thornburg may identify economic sectors it expects to experience growth. At times this approach may
produce a focus on certain industries, such as technology, financial services, healthcare or biotechnology. The exposure to particular economic sectors or industries likely will vary over time. Investment decisions are also based on domestic and
international economic developments, outlooks for securities markets, interest rates and inflation, and the supply and demand for debt and equity securities.  Debt obligations, usually with associated equity features, occasionally will be considered for investment when Thornburg believes them to be more attractive than equity alternatives. The Fund may purchase debt
obligations of any maturity and of any quality.  ","Principal Investment Strategies

The Fund expects to invest primarily in domestic
equity securities (primarily common stocks) selected for
their growth potential. However, the Fund may own a
variety of securities, including foreign equity
securities, partnership interests, and domestic and
foreign debt obligations. The Fund may invest in
developing countries.

The Funds investment advisor, Thornburg Investment
Management, Inc. (Thornburg) intends to invest in
companies that it believes will have growing revenues
and earnings. The Fund can invest in companies of any
size, from larger, well-established companies to
smaller, emerging growth companies.

Thornburg primarily uses individual issuer and industry
analysis to make investment decisions. Among the

.  Growth Industry Leaders are fast growing companies that appear to have
proprietary advantages in industry segments that are experiencing rapid
growth.  Stocks of these companies generally sell at premium valuations
(relative to the S&P; Composite 1500 Index).

.  Consistent Growth Companies. Stocks in this category generally sell at
premium valuations (relative to the S&P; Composite 1500 Index) and tend to
show steady revenue and earnings growth.

.  Emerging Growth Companies are typically growing companies that in
Thornburg's opinion are in the process of establishing a leading position
in a significant product, service or market and which Thornburg expects
will grow, or continue to grow, at a rate exceeding the growth of the U.S.
gross domestic product (""GDP"").  These companies may not be profitable at
the time of purchase.

In conjunction with individual issuer analysis, Thornburg may identify
economic sectors it expects to experience growth.  At times this approach
may produce a focus on certain industries, such as technology, financial
services, healthcare or biotechnology.  The exposure to particular economic
sectors or industries likely will vary over time.  Investment decisions are
also based on domestic and international economic developments, outlooks
for securities markets, interest rates and inflation, and the supply and
demand for debt and equity securities.

Debt obligations, usually with associated equity features, occasionally
will be considered for investment when Thornburg believes them to be more
attractive than equity alternatives.  The Fund may purchase debt
obligations of any maturity and of any quality.

The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities
to pursue its principal investment strategies.  Portfolio turnover may
exceed 100% per year.  This could result in taxable capital gains
distributions to shareholders, and increased transaction costs which may
affect Fund performance.

"Principal Investment Risks 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. Accordingly, the loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the Fund’s shares varies from day to day and over time, and when you sell your shares they may be worth less than what you paid for them. The following is a summary of the principal risks of investing in the Fund.
Management Risk – The Fund is an actively managed portfolio, and the value of the Fund may be reduced if Thornburg pursues unsuccessful investments or fails to correctly identify risks affecting the broad economy or specific issuers in which the Fund invests.
Market and Economic Risk – The value of the Fund’s investments may decline and its share value may be reduced due to changes in general economic and market conditions. The value of a security may change in response to developments affecting entire economies, markets or industries, including changes in interest rates, political and legal developments, and general market volatility.
Risks Affecting Specific Issuers – The value of an equity security or debt obligation may decline in response to developments affecting the specific issuer of the security or obligation, even if the overall industry or economy is unaffected. These developments may include a variety of factors, including but not limited to management issues or other corporate disruption, a decline in revenues or profitability, an increase in costs, or an adverse effect on the issuer’s competitive position. 
Small and Mid-Cap Company Risk – Investments in small-capitalization companies and mid-capitalization companies, including smaller, earlier stage companies, may involve additional risks.  These risks may be relatively higher with smaller companies. These additional risks may result from limited product lines, more limited access to markets and financial resources, greater vulnerability to competition and changes in markets, lack of management depth, increased volatility in share price, and possible difficulties in valuing or selling these investments.

Foreign Investment Risk – Investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve risks including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political instability, confiscations, taxes or restrictions on currency exchange, difficulty in selling foreign investments, and reduced legal protection. These risks may be more pronounced for investments in developing countries. 
Credit Risk – If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings agencies or go into default, or if management action, legislation or other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Fund’s share value and any dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced. Because the ability of an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly “junk” or “high yield” bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher-rated debt obligation, lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk.
Interest Rate Risk – When interest rates increase, the value of the Fund’s investments in debt obligations may decline and the Fund’s share value may be reduced. This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to reinvest at lower interest rates.
Liquidity Risk – Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to sell some or all of its investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices.

financial resources, greater vulnerability to competition and changes in markets, lack of management depth, increased volatility in share price, and possible difficulties in valuing or selling these investments. 
Foreign Investment Risk  Investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve risks including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, political instability, confiscations, taxes or restrictions on currency exchange, difficulty in selling foreign investments, and reduced legal protection. These risks may be more pronounced for investments in developing countries. 
 Credit Risk  If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings agencies or go into default, or if management action,
legislation or other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Funds share value and any dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced. Because
the ability of an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly junk or high yield bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher-rated debt
obligation, lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk. 
Interest Rate Risk  When interest rates increase, the value of the Funds investments in debt obligations may decline and the Funds
share value may be reduced. This effect is typically  
  53

    GROWTH FUND  


more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to
reinvest at lower interest rates.  Liquidity Risk  Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to
sell some or all of its investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices.  Additional information about Fund
investments, investment strategies, and risks of investing in the Fund appears below beginning on page 81.  Past Performance of
the Fund  The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in Growth Fund by showing how the Funds investment
results vary from year to year. The bar chart shows how the annual total returns for Class A shares have been different in each full year shown. The average annual total return figures compare Class A, Class C and Class I share
performance to the Russell 3000 Growth Index, a broad measure of market performance. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. The performance information shown is as of
the calendar year ended December 31, 2017. Updated performance information may be obtained on the Thornburg website at www.thornburg.com or by calling 1-800-847-0200.  Annual Total Returns  Class A Shares

 After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal
income tax rates, and do not reflect state or local income taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investors own tax situation and may differ from the returns shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The
after-tax returns shown relate only to Class A shares, and after-tax returns for other share classes will vary.

Tax Information  The Fund seeks to satisfy conditions that will permit distributions by the Fund from its net interest income to be exempt from
federal income tax. Income distributions that are exempt from federal income tax may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and to state and local income taxes. Any capital gains distributions generally are subject to federal and state
income tax. See Taxes on page 105 of this Prospectus. 
 

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries 
If you purchase shares of a Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund, its investment advisor and/or its
distributor may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediarys website for more information.

Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) and/or Thornburg Securities Corporation (TSC) have contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses incurred by the Fund so that actual
Class I expenses do not exceed 0.99%. The agreement to waive fees and reimburse expenses may be terminated by the Funds Trustees at any time, but may not be terminated by Thornburg or TSC before February 1, 2019, unless Thornburg or
TSC ceases to be the investment advisor or distributor of the Fund prior to that date. Thornburg and TSC may recoup amounts waived or reimbursed during the fiscal year if actual expenses fall below the expense cap during that year.
 
Example. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of
investing in other mutual funds.  The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your
shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, dividends and distributions are reinvested, and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be
higher or lower, based on these assumptions (and giving effect to fee waivers and expense reimbursements in the first year), your costs would be:

 Portfolio Turnover. The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities
(or turns over) its portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund
Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 60.88% of the average value of its portfolio. 
Principal Investment Strategies  The
Fund expects to invest primarily in equity securities from issuers around the world (primarily common stocks) selected for their growth potential and, under normal market conditions, invests at least 75% of its assets in foreign securities or
depository receipts of foreign securities. However, the Fund may own a variety of securities, including domestic equity securities and partnership interests. The Fund may invest in developing countries. 
The Funds investment advisor, Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) intends to invest in companies that it believes will have
growing revenues and earnings. The Fund can invest in companies of any size, from larger, well-established companies to smaller, emerging growth companies. 
Thornburg primarily uses individual issuer and industry analysis to make investment decisions. Among the specific factors
 
  56 


Table of Contents




INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND       

considered by Thornburg in identifying securities for inclusion in the Fund are: 
 






   earnings growth potential
 
  
   price/revenue ratio
 

   business model
 
  
   PE/growth rate ratio
 

   industry growth potential
 
  
   price/cash flow ratio
 

   industry leadership
  
   enterprise value/EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio  

   asset appreciation potential
 
  
   management strength

   potential size of business
 
  
   debt/capital ratio

   price/earnings ratio
  

 The Fund typically makes equity investments in the following three types of companies:  
Growth Industry Leaders: Companies in this category often have leadership positions in growing markets. In some cases these companies may have dominant
market share. These companies tend to be larger and more established.  Consistent Growers: Companies in this category generally exhibit steady
earnings or revenue growth, or both. These companies may have subscription or other recurring revenue profiles. Given their business models, these companies may outperform in weak markets. 
Emerging Growth Companies: Companies often addressing a new market or carving out a niche in an existing market. Companies in this category may
experience rapid growth, and tend to be smaller, earlier stage companies. These companies may exhibit high volatility.  There is no assurance that
any company selected for investment will, once categorized in one of the three described investment categories, continue to have the positive characteristics or fulfill the expectations that the advisor had for the company when it was selected for
investment, and any such company may not grow or may decline in earnings and size.  In conjunction with individual issuer analysis, Thornburg may identify
economic sectors it expects to experience growth. At times this approach may produce a focus on certain industries, such as technology, financial services, healthcare or biotechnology. The exposure to particular economic sectors or industries likely
will vary over time. Investment decisions are also based on domestic and international economic developments, outlooks for securities markets, interest rates and inflation, and the supply and demand for debt and equity securities. 
Debt obligations, usually with associated equity features, occasionally will be considered for investment when Thornburg believes them to be more attractive
than equity alternatives. The Fund may purchase debt obligations of any maturity and of any credit quality, including high yield or junk bonds. There is no minimum credit quality or rating of debt obligation the Fund may
purchase. 
Principal Investment Risks 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental
agency. Accordingly, the loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the Funds shares varies from day to day and over time, and when you sell your shares they may be worth less than what you paid for them. The following is a
summary of the principal risks of investing in the Fund.  Management Risk  The Fund is an actively managed portfolio, and the value of the
Fund may be reduced if Thornburg pursues unsuccessful investments or fails to correctly identify risks affecting the broad economy or specific issuers in which the Fund invests. 
Market and Economic Risk  The value of the Funds investments may decline and its share value may be reduced due to changes in general
economic and market conditions. The value of a security may change in response to developments affecting entire economies, markets or industries, including changes in interest rates, political and legal developments, and general market volatility.
 Risks Affecting Specific Issuers  The value of an equity security or debt obligation may decline in response to developments affecting the
specific issuer of the security or obligation, even if the overall industry or economy is unaffected. These developments may include a variety of factors, including but not limited to management issues or other corporate disruption, a decline in
revenues or profitability, an increase in costs, or an adverse effect on the issuers competitive position.  Foreign Investment Risk 
Investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve risks including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political instability, confiscations, taxes or restrictions on currency exchange, difficulty in selling foreign investments,
and reduced legal protection.  Developing Country Risk  The risks which may affect investments in foreign issuers (see Foreign
Investment Risk, above) may be more pronounced for investments in developing countries because the economies of those countries are usually less diversified, communications, transportation and economic infrastructures are less developed, and
developing countries ordinarily have less established legal, political, business and social frameworks. At times the prices of equity securities or debt obligations of a developing country issuer may be extremely volatile. An issuer domiciled in a
developed country may be similarly affected by these developing country risks to the extent that the issuer conducts its business in developing countries. 
Small and Mid-Cap Company Risk  Investments in small-capitalization companies and mid-capitalization companies may involve additional risks, which may be relatively higher with smaller companies. These additional risks may result from limited product lines, more limited access to markets and
financial resources, greater vulnerability to competition and changes in markets, lack of management depth, increased

volatility in share price, and possible difficulties in valuing or selling these investments. 
Credit Risk  If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings agencies or go into default, or if management action, legislation or
other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Funds share value and any dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced. Because the ability of
an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly junk or high yield bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher-rated debt obligation,
lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk. 
Interest Rate Risk  When interest rates increase, the value of the Funds investments in debt obligations may decline and the Funds
share value may be reduced. This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to
reinvest at lower interest rates.  Liquidity Risk  Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to
sell some or all of its investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices. This risk may be more pronounced for the Funds investments in developing countries.

results vary from year to year. The bar chart shows how the annual total returns for Class A shares have been different in each full year shown. The average annual total return figures compare Class A, Class C and Class I share
performance to the Russell 3000 Growth Index, a broad measure of market performance. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. The performance information shown is as of
the calendar year ended December 31, 2017. Updated performance information may be obtained on the Thornburg website at www.thornburg.com or by calling 1-800-847-0200.  Annual Total Returns  Class A Shares

 After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal
income tax rates, and do not reflect state or local income taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investors own tax situation and may differ from the returns shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The
after-tax returns shown relate only to Class A shares, and after-tax returns for other share classes will vary.

Tax Information  The Fund seeks to satisfy conditions that will permit distributions by the Fund from its net interest income to be exempt from
federal income tax. Income distributions that are exempt from federal income tax may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and to state and local income taxes. Any capital gains distributions generally are subject to federal and state
income tax. See Taxes on page 105 of this Prospectus. 
 

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries 
If you purchase shares of a Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund, its investment advisor and/or its
distributor may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another
investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediarys website for more information.

Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) and/or Thornburg Securities Corporation (TSC) have contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses incurred by the Fund so that actual
Class I expenses do not exceed 0.99%. The agreement to waive fees and reimburse expenses may be terminated by the Funds Trustees at any time, but may not be terminated by Thornburg or TSC before February 1, 2019, unless Thornburg or
TSC ceases to be the investment advisor or distributor of the Fund prior to that date. Thornburg and TSC may recoup amounts waived or reimbursed during the fiscal year if actual expenses fall below the expense cap during that year.
 
Example. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of
investing in other mutual funds.  The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your
shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, dividends and distributions are reinvested, and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be
higher or lower, based on these assumptions (and giving effect to fee waivers and expense reimbursements in the first year), your costs would be:

 Portfolio Turnover. The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities
(or turns over) its portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund
Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 60.88% of the average value of its portfolio. 
Principal Investment Strategies  The
Fund expects to invest primarily in equity securities from issuers around the world (primarily common stocks) selected for their growth potential and, under normal market conditions, invests at least 75% of its assets in foreign securities or
depository receipts of foreign securities. However, the Fund may own a variety of securities, including domestic equity securities and partnership interests. The Fund may invest in developing countries. 
The Funds investment advisor, Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) intends to invest in companies that it believes will have
growing revenues and earnings. The Fund can invest in companies of any size, from larger, well-established companies to smaller, emerging growth companies. 
Thornburg primarily uses individual issuer and industry analysis to make investment decisions. Among the specific factors
 
  56 


Table of Contents




INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND       

considered by Thornburg in identifying securities for inclusion in the Fund are: 
 






   earnings growth potential
 
  
   price/revenue ratio
 

   business model
 
  
   PE/growth rate ratio
 

   industry growth potential
 
  
   price/cash flow ratio
 

   industry leadership
  
   enterprise value/EBITDA (earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) ratio  

   asset appreciation potential
 
  
   management strength

   potential size of business
 
  
   debt/capital ratio

   price/earnings ratio
  

 The Fund typically makes equity investments in the following three types of companies:  
Growth Industry Leaders: Companies in this category often have leadership positions in growing markets. In some cases these companies may have dominant
market share. These companies tend to be larger and more established.  Consistent Growers: Companies in this category generally exhibit steady
earnings or revenue growth, or both. These companies may have subscription or other recurring revenue profiles. Given their business models, these companies may outperform in weak markets. 
Emerging Growth Companies: Companies often addressing a new market or carving out a niche in an existing market. Companies in this category may
experience rapid growth, and tend to be smaller, earlier stage companies. These companies may exhibit high volatility.  There is no assurance that
any company selected for investment will, once categorized in one of the three described investment categories, continue to have the positive characteristics or fulfill the expectations that the advisor had for the company when it was selected for
investment, and any such company may not grow or may decline in earnings and size.  In conjunction with individual issuer analysis, Thornburg may identify
economic sectors it expects to experience growth. At times this approach may produce a focus on certain industries, such as technology, financial services, healthcare or biotechnology. The exposure to particular economic sectors or industries likely
will vary over time. Investment decisions are also based on domestic and international economic developments, outlooks for securities markets, interest rates and inflation, and the supply and demand for debt and equity securities. 
Debt obligations, usually with associated equity features, occasionally will be considered for investment when Thornburg believes them to be more attractive
than equity alternatives. The Fund may purchase debt obligations of any maturity and of any credit quality, including high yield or junk bonds. There is no minimum credit quality or rating of debt obligation the Fund may
purchase. 
Principal Investment Risks 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental
agency. Accordingly, the loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the Funds shares varies from day to day and over time, and when you sell your shares they may be worth less than what you paid for them. The following is a
summary of the principal risks of investing in the Fund.  Management Risk  The Fund is an actively managed portfolio, and the value of the
Fund may be reduced if Thornburg pursues unsuccessful investments or fails to correctly identify risks affecting the broad economy or specific issuers in which the Fund invests. 
Market and Economic Risk  The value of the Funds investments may decline and its share value may be reduced due to changes in general
economic and market conditions. The value of a security may change in response to developments affecting entire economies, markets or industries, including changes in interest rates, political and legal developments, and general market volatility.
 Risks Affecting Specific Issuers  The value of an equity security or debt obligation may decline in response to developments affecting the
specific issuer of the security or obligation, even if the overall industry or economy is unaffected. These developments may include a variety of factors, including but not limited to management issues or other corporate disruption, a decline in
revenues or profitability, an increase in costs, or an adverse effect on the issuers competitive position.  Foreign Investment Risk 
Investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve risks including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political instability, confiscations, taxes or restrictions on currency exchange, difficulty in selling foreign investments,
and reduced legal protection.  Developing Country Risk  The risks which may affect investments in foreign issuers (see Foreign
Investment Risk, above) may be more pronounced for investments in developing countries because the economies of those countries are usually less diversified, communications, transportation and economic infrastructures are less developed, and
developing countries ordinarily have less established legal, political, business and social frameworks. At times the prices of equity securities or debt obligations of a developing country issuer may be extremely volatile. An issuer domiciled in a
developed country may be similarly affected by these developing country risks to the extent that the issuer conducts its business in developing countries. 
Small and Mid-Cap Company Risk  Investments in small-capitalization companies and mid-capitalization companies may involve additional risks, which may be relatively higher with smaller companies. These additional risks may result from limited product lines, more limited access to markets and
financial resources, greater vulnerability to competition and changes in markets, lack of management depth, increased
 
  57

    INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND  

volatility in share price, and possible difficulties in valuing or selling these investments. 
Credit Risk  If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings agencies or go into default, or if management action, legislation or
other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Funds share value and any dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced. Because the ability of
an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly junk or high yield bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher-rated debt obligation,
lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk. 
Interest Rate Risk  When interest rates increase, the value of the Funds investments in debt obligations may decline and the Funds
share value may be reduced. This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to
reinvest at lower interest rates.  Liquidity Risk  Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to
sell some or all of its investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices. This risk may be more pronounced for the Funds investments in developing countries.

action, legislation or other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Funds share
value and any dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced. Because the ability of an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly junk or high yield bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is
typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher-rated debt obligation, lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk. 
Interest Rate Risk  When interest rates increase, the value of the Funds investments in debt obligations may decline and the Funds
share value may be reduced. This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to
reinvest at lower interest rates.  Liquidity Risk  Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to
sell some or all of its investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices.  Additional information about Fund
investments, investment strategies, and risks of investing in the Fund appears below beginning on page 79.  Past Performance of
the Fund  The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in Growth Fund by showing how the Funds investment
results vary from year to year. The bar chart shows how the annual total returns for Class A shares have been different in each full year shown. The average annual total return figures compare Class A, Class C and Class I share performance to the
Russell 3000 Growth Index, a broad measure of market performance. Past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future. The performance information shown below is as of the calendar
year ended December 31, 2016. Updated performance information may be obtained on the Thornburg website at www. thornburg.com or by calling 1-800-847-0200.

 After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect state
or local income taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investors own tax situation and may differ from the returns shown, and after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred
arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. The after-tax returns shown relate only to Class A shares, and after-tax returns will vary for Class C and Class I shares because the returns of the classes are different.

Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) and/or Thornburg Securities Corporation (TSC) have contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses incurred by the Fund so that actual
Class I expenses do not exceed 0.99%. The agreement to waive fees and reimburse expenses may be terminated by the Fund at any time, but may not be terminated by Thornburg or TSC before [February 1, 2018], unless Thornburg or TSC ceases to be the
investment advisor or distributor of the Fund prior to that date. Thornburg and TSC retain the ability to be repaid by the Fund for fee waivers and expense reimbursements during a fiscal year if Fund expenses fall below the relevant percentage
threshold before the end of that fiscal year. 

Example. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of
investing in other mutual funds.  The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your
shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, dividends and distributions are reinvested, and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be
higher or lower, based on these assumptions (and giving effect to fee waivers and expense reimbursements in the first year), your costs would be:

 Portfolio Turnover. The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities
(or turns over) its portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund
Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 103.96% of the average value of its portfolio. 
Principal Investment Strategies  The
Fund expects to invest primarily in equity securities from issuers around the world (primarily common stocks) selected for their growth potential and, under normal market conditions, invests at least 75% of its assets in foreign securities or
depository receipts of foreign securities. However, the Fund may own a variety of securities, including domestic equity securities and partnership interests. The Fund may invest in developing countries. 
The Funds investment advisor, Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) intends to invest in companies that it believes will have
growing revenues and earnings. The Fund can invest in companies of any size, from  
  58 


Table of Contents




INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND      

larger, well-established companies to smaller, emerging growth companies. 
Thornburg primarily uses individual issuer and industry analysis to make investment decisions. Among the specific factors considered by Thornburg in
identifying securities for inclusion in the Fund are:   






     earnings growth potential
  
     price/revenue ratio




     business model
  
     PE/growth rate ratio




     industry growth potential
  
     price/cash flow ratio




     industry leadership
  
     enterprise value/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) ratio




     asset appreciation potential
  
     management strength




     potential size of business
  
     debt/capital ratio




     price/earnings ratio
  

 The Fund typically makes equity investments in the following three types of companies: 
Growth Industry Leaders: Companies in this category often have leadership positions in growing markets. In some cases these companies may have dominant
market share. These companies tend to be larger and more established.  Consistent Growers: Companies in this category generally exhibit steady
earnings or revenue growth, or both. These companies may have subscription or other recurring revenue profiles. Given their business models, these companies may outperform in weak markets. 
Emerging Growth Companies: Companies often addressing a new market or carving out a niche in an existing market. Companies in this category may
experience rapid growth, and tend to be smaller, earlier stage companies. These companies may exhibit high volatility.  In conjunction with
individual issuer analysis, Thornburg may identify economic sectors it expects to experience growth. At times this approach may produce a focus on certain industries, such as technology, financial services, health-care or biotechnology. The exposure
to particular economic sectors or industries likely will vary over time. Investment decisions are also based on domestic and international economic developments, outlooks for securities markets, interest rates and inflation, and the supply and
demand for debt and equity securities.  Debt obligations, usually with associated equity features, occasionally will be considered for investment when
Thornburg believes them to be more attractive than equity alternatives. The Fund may purchase debt obligations of any maturity and of any credit quality, including high yield or junk bonds. There is no minimum credit quality
or rating of debt obligation the Fund may purchase. 
Principal Investment Risks 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental
agency. Accordingly, the loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the Funds shares varies from day to day and over time, and when you sell your shares they may be worth less than what you paid for them. The following is a
summary of the principal risks of investing in the Fund.  Management Risk  The Fund is an actively managed portfolio, and the value of the
Fund may be reduced if Thornburg pursues unsuccessful investments or fails to correctly identify risks affecting the broad economy or specific issuers in which the Fund invests. 
Market and Economic Risk  The value of the Funds investments may decline and its share value may be reduced due to changes in general
economic and market conditions. The value of a security may change in response to developments affecting entire economies, markets or industries, including changes in interest rates, political and legal developments, and general market volatility.
 Risks Affecting Specific Issuers  The value of an equity security or debt obligation may decline in response to developments affecting the
specific issuer of the security or obligation, even if the overall industry or economy is unaffected. These developments may include a variety of factors, including but not limited to management issues or other corporate disruption, a decline in
revenues or profitability, an increase in costs, or an adverse effect on the issuers competitive position.  Foreign Investment Risk 
Investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve risks including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political instability, confiscations, taxes or restrictions on currency exchange, difficulty in selling foreign investments,
and reduced legal protection.  Developing Country Risk  The risks which may affect investments in foreign issuers (see Foreign
Investment Risk, above) may be more pronounced for investments in developing countries because the economies of those countries are usually less diversified, communications, transportation and economic infrastructures are less developed, and
developing countries ordinarily have less established legal, political, business and social frameworks. At times the prices of equity securities or debt obligations of a developing country issuer may be extremely volatile. An issuer domiciled in a
developed country may be similarly affected by these developing country risks to the extent that the issuer conducts its business in developing countries.

    INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND  

Small and Mid-Cap Company Risk  Investments in small-capitalization companies and
mid-capitalization companies may involve additional risks, which may be relatively higher with smaller companies. These additional risks may result from limited product lines, more limited access to markets and financial resources, greater
vulnerability to competition and changes in markets, lack of management depth, increased volatility in share price, and possible difficulties in valuing or selling these investments. 
Credit Risk  If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings agencies or go into default, or if management action, legislation or
other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Funds share value and any dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced. Because the ability of
an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly junk or high yield bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher-rated debt obligation,
lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk. 
Interest Rate Risk  When interest rates increase, the value of the Funds investments in debt obligations may decline and the Funds
share value may be reduced. This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to
reinvest at lower interest rates.  Liquidity Risk  Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to
sell some or all of its investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices. This risk may be more pronounced for the Funds investments in developing countries.

Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) and/or Thornburg Securities Corporation (TSC) have contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses incurred by the Fund so that actual
Class I expenses do not exceed 0.99%. The agreement to waive fees and reimburse expenses may be terminated by the Fund at any time, but may not be terminated by Thornburg or TSC before [February 1, 2018], unless Thornburg or TSC ceases to be the
investment advisor or distributor of the Fund prior to that date. Thornburg and TSC retain the ability to be repaid by the Fund for fee waivers and expense reimbursements during a fiscal year if Fund expenses fall below the relevant percentage
threshold before the end of that fiscal year. 

Example. This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of
investing in other mutual funds.  The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your
shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, dividends and distributions are reinvested, and that the Funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be
higher or lower, based on these assumptions (and giving effect to fee waivers and expense reimbursements in the first year), your costs would be:

 Portfolio Turnover. The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities
(or turns over) its portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund
Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Funds portfolio turnover rate was 103.96% of the average value of its portfolio. 
Principal Investment Strategies  The
Fund expects to invest primarily in equity securities from issuers around the world (primarily common stocks) selected for their growth potential and, under normal market conditions, invests at least 75% of its assets in foreign securities or
depository receipts of foreign securities. However, the Fund may own a variety of securities, including domestic equity securities and partnership interests. The Fund may invest in developing countries. 
The Funds investment advisor, Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. (Thornburg) intends to invest in companies that it believes will have
growing revenues and earnings. The Fund can invest in companies of any size, from  
  58 


Table of Contents




INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND      

larger, well-established companies to smaller, emerging growth companies. 
Thornburg primarily uses individual issuer and industry analysis to make investment decisions. Among the specific factors considered by Thornburg in
identifying securities for inclusion in the Fund are:   






     earnings growth potential
  
     price/revenue ratio




     business model
  
     PE/growth rate ratio




     industry growth potential
  
     price/cash flow ratio




     industry leadership
  
     enterprise value/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) ratio




     asset appreciation potential
  
     management strength




     potential size of business
  
     debt/capital ratio




     price/earnings ratio
  

 The Fund typically makes equity investments in the following three types of companies: 
Growth Industry Leaders: Companies in this category often have leadership positions in growing markets. In some cases these companies may have dominant
market share. These companies tend to be larger and more established.  Consistent Growers: Companies in this category generally exhibit steady
earnings or revenue growth, or both. These companies may have subscription or other recurring revenue profiles. Given their business models, these companies may outperform in weak markets. 
Emerging Growth Companies: Companies often addressing a new market or carving out a niche in an existing market. Companies in this category may
experience rapid growth, and tend to be smaller, earlier stage companies. These companies may exhibit high volatility.  In conjunction with
individual issuer analysis, Thornburg may identify economic sectors it expects to experience growth. At times this approach may produce a focus on certain industries, such as technology, financial services, health-care or biotechnology. The exposure
to particular economic sectors or industries likely will vary over time. Investment decisions are also based on domestic and international economic developments, outlooks for securities markets, interest rates and inflation, and the supply and
demand for debt and equity securities.  Debt obligations, usually with associated equity features, occasionally will be considered for investment when
Thornburg believes them to be more attractive than equity alternatives. The Fund may purchase debt obligations of any maturity and of any credit quality, including high yield or junk bonds. There is no minimum credit quality
or rating of debt obligation the Fund may purchase. 
Principal Investment Risks 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental
agency. Accordingly, the loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the Funds shares varies from day to day and over time, and when you sell your shares they may be worth less than what you paid for them. The following is a
summary of the principal risks of investing in the Fund.  Management Risk  The Fund is an actively managed portfolio, and the value of the
Fund may be reduced if Thornburg pursues unsuccessful investments or fails to correctly identify risks affecting the broad economy or specific issuers in which the Fund invests. 
Market and Economic Risk  The value of the Funds investments may decline and its share value may be reduced due to changes in general
economic and market conditions. The value of a security may change in response to developments affecting entire economies, markets or industries, including changes in interest rates, political and legal developments, and general market volatility.
 Risks Affecting Specific Issuers  The value of an equity security or debt obligation may decline in response to developments affecting the
specific issuer of the security or obligation, even if the overall industry or economy is unaffected. These developments may include a variety of factors, including but not limited to management issues or other corporate disruption, a decline in
revenues or profitability, an increase in costs, or an adverse effect on the issuers competitive position.  Foreign Investment Risk 
Investments in securities of foreign issuers may involve risks including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political instability, confiscations, taxes or restrictions on currency exchange, difficulty in selling foreign investments,
and reduced legal protection.  Developing Country Risk  The risks which may affect investments in foreign issuers (see Foreign
Investment Risk, above) may be more pronounced for investments in developing countries because the economies of those countries are usually less diversified, communications, transportation and economic infrastructures are less developed, and
developing countries ordinarily have less established legal, political, business and social frameworks. At times the prices of equity securities or debt obligations of a developing country issuer may be extremely volatile. An issuer domiciled in a
developed country may be similarly affected by these developing country risks to the extent that the issuer conducts its business in developing countries.

    INTERNATIONAL GROWTH FUND  

Small and Mid-Cap Company Risk  Investments in small-capitalization companies and
mid-capitalization companies may involve additional risks, which may be relatively higher with smaller companies. These additional risks may result from limited product lines, more limited access to markets and financial resources, greater
vulnerability to competition and changes in markets, lack of management depth, increased volatility in share price, and possible difficulties in valuing or selling these investments. 
Credit Risk  If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings agencies or go into default, or if management action, legislation or
other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Funds share value and any dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced. Because the ability of
an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly junk or high yield bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher-rated debt obligation,
lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk. 
Interest Rate Risk  When interest rates increase, the value of the Funds investments in debt obligations may decline and the Funds
share value may be reduced. This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to
reinvest at lower interest rates.  Liquidity Risk  Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to
sell some or all of its investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices. This risk may be more pronounced for the Funds investments in developing countries.

","Principal Investment Risks 
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency.
Accordingly, the loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund. The value of the Funds shares varies from day to day and over time, and when you sell your shares they may be worth less than what you paid for them. The following is a summary
of the principal risks of investing in the Fund.  Management Risk  The Fund is an actively managed portfolio, and the value of the Fund may be reduced
if Thornburg pursues unsuccessful investments or fails to correctly identify risks affecting the broad economy or specific issuers in which the Fund invests. 
Market and Economic Risk  The value of the Funds investments may decline and its share value may be reduced due to changes in general economic and
market conditions. The value of a security may change in response to developments affecting entire economies, markets or industries, including changes in interest rates, political and legal developments, and general market volatility. 
Risks Affecting Specific Issuers  The value of an equity security or debt obligation may decline in response to developments affecting the specific issuer
of the security or obligation, even if the overall industry or economy is unaffected. These developments may include a variety of factors, including but not limited to management issues or other corporate disruption, a decline in revenues or
profitability, an increase in costs, or an adverse effect on the issuers competitive position.  Foreign Investment Risk  Investments in
securities of foreign issuers may involve risks including adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, political instability, confiscations, taxes or restrictions on currency exchange, difficulty in selling foreign investments, and reduced legal
protection. These risks may be more pronounced for investments in developing countries because the economies of those countries are usually less diversified, communications, transportation and economic infrastructures are less developed, and
developing countries ordinarily have less established legal, political, business and social frameworks. At times the prices of equity securities or debt obligations of a developing country issuer may be extremely volatile. An issuer domiciled in a
developed country may be similarly affected by these developing country risks to the extent that the issuer conducts a significant percentage of its business in developing countries. 
Smaller Company Risk  Investments in smaller companies may involve additional risks because of limited product lines, limited access to markets and
financial resources, greater vulnerability to competition and changes in markets, lack of management depth, increased volatility in share price, and possible difficulties in valuing or selling the investments.

Credit Risk  If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings agencies or go into default, or
if management action, legislation or other government action reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the value of those debt obligations may decline and the Funds share value and any dividends paid by the Fund
may be reduced. Because the ability of an issuer of a lower-rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly junk or high yield bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is typically less certain than for an
issuer of a higher-rated debt obligation, lower-rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than higher-rated debt obligations to default, to ratings downgrades, and to liquidity risk. 
Interest Rate Risk  When interest rates increase, the value of the Funds investments in debt obligations may decline and the Funds share value
may be reduced. This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and longer-term debt obligations. Decreases in market interest rates may result in prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to reinvest at lower
interest rates.  Liquidity Risk  Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other factors, the Fund may not be able to sell some or all of the
investments promptly, or may only be able to sell investments at less than desired prices. This risk may be more pronounced for the Funds investments in developing countries.

","Principal Investment Risks
--------------------------
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in any bank and is not insured or
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other
governmental agency.  Accordingly, the loss of money is a risk of investing in
the Fund.  The value of the Fund's shares varies from day to day and over time,
and when you sell your shares they may be worth less than what you paid for
them.  The following is a description of the principal risks of investing in
the Fund.

*  Management Risk - The Fund is an actively managed portfolio, and the value
   of the Fund's investments can be reduced if Thornburg pursues unsuccessful
   investment strategies, fails to correctly identify market risks affecting
   the broader economy or specific issuers in which the Fund invests, or
   otherwise engages in poor selection of investments for the Fund.

*  Market Risk - The value of the Fund's investments may decline and the Fund's
   share value may be reduced due to changes in general economic and market
   conditions.  The value of an equity security or debt obligation may change
   in response to developments affecting entire economies, markets or
   industries, including changes in interest rates, market volatility, and
   political and legal developments.  The value of an equity security or debt
   obligation may also change in response to developments affecting a specific
   issuer, including changes in the issuer's earnings and dividends.

*  Smaller Company Risk - Investments in smaller companies may involve
   additional risks because of limited product lines, limited access to markets
   and financial resources, greater vulnerability to competition and changes in
   markets, increased volatility in price, and possible difficulty in selling
   the investments.

*  Foreign Investment Risk - Investments in the equity securities or debt
   obligations of foreign issuers may involve additional risks including
   changes in currency exchange rates which adversely affect the Fund's
   investments, economic and political instability, confiscation, inability or
   delays in selling foreign investments, and reduced legal protections for
   investments.  These risks may be more pronounced for investments in emerging
   markets.

*  Credit Risk - If debt obligations held by the Fund are downgraded by ratings
   agencies or go into default, or if legislation or other government action
   reduces the ability of issuers to pay principal and interest when due, the
   value of those debt obligations may decline and the Fund's share value and
   the dividends paid by the Fund may be reduced.  Because the ability of an
   issuer of a lower rated or unrated debt obligation (including particularly
   ""junk"" or ""high yield"" bonds) to pay principal and interest when due is
   typically less certain than for an issuer of a higher rated debt obligation,
   lower rated and unrated debt obligations are generally more vulnerable than
   higher rated debt obligations to default and to downgrades.

*  Interest Rate Risk - When interest rates increase, the value of the Fund's
   investments in debt obligations may decline and the Fund's share value may
   be reduced.  This effect is typically more pronounced for intermediate and
   longer term debt obligations owned by the Fund.  This effect is also
   typically more pronounced for the Fund's investment in lower rated and
   unrated debt obligations (including particularly ""junk"" or ""high yield""
   bonds), the value of which may fluctuate more significantly in response to
   interest rate changes.  Decreases in market interest rates may result in
   prepayments of debt obligations the Fund acquires, requiring the Fund to
   reinvest at lower interest rates.

*  Liquidity Risk - Due to a lack of demand in the marketplace or other
   factors, the Fund may not be able to sell some or all of the investments
   that it holds, or may only be able to sell those investments at less than
   desired prices.

The value of the Fund's investments varies from day to day, generally
reflecting changes in market conditions, political and economic news,
declines in corporate dividends, industry and technological developments,
changes in interest rates, and developments affecting specific companies
and other issuers of securities.  The value of the Fund's investments can
be reduced by unsuccessful investment strategies, poor selection of equity
securities and debt obligations, changes in industry leadership, poor
economic growth, pronounced market volatility, and political and legal
